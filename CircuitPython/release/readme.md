TO BE CONSTRUCTED AFTER THE DEVELOPMENT

# How to use
`code.py` contains the test code that will test the hardware of the traffic light development board.

Copy everything in this directory to the root of "CircuitPython" Drive. 
Once the copy is done, the test program will run automatically.
(No IDE needed.)
